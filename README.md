# Root Cellar
Preserve what you grow. Track what you store

Root Cellar helps home cooks and homesteaders track freezer/pantry items, providing expiration reminders. Later, Iâ€™ll add basic nutrition/carbohydrate info for homemade meals.

## Module 2 (current) 
- Meals list (MainActivity)
- Add Meal flow (returns result)
- Meal detail with two tabs (fragments): Ingredients | Nutrition
- Expiration reminder notification
- Material theme (light/dark)
- Share meal info via intent

## Build & Run
- Android Studio (latest), Java, Gradle  
- Emulator: Pixel 7 (any recent API)

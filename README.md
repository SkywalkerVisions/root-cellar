# Root Cellar

This app idea came from wanting an easier way to keep track of what I have stored in the freezer and pantry. It’s basically a place where I can log meals or ingredients and get reminders before things expire. Later on, I want to add some nutrition info (like carbs) so it’s more useful for planning homemade meals.

---

## What I worked on earlier (Modules 2–4)
- Set up a meal list screen (MainActivity).
- Added the ability to add a meal and return results.
- Created a detail screen with two tabs (Ingredients | Nutrition).
- Started on expiration reminders.
- Added light and dark theme.
- Tried out sharing meal info with intents.
- Made some wireframes for Module 3.
- Wrote a short summary for Module 4.

---

## Module 5 — What’s New
- I started setting up a list → detail flow (so when you click on an item, it shows more info).
- I added a `docs/outline.md` file to keep track of what I’m changing week by week.
- Updated this README to show my Module 5 progress.
- Next I want to swap out the “fake data” I’m using now with something real (like Room database or maybe an API).

---

## How to Run It
- The easiest way is just open it in Android Studio and hit the green Run ▶ button.
- I’ve been testing it on a Pixel 7 emulator, but it should work on other setups too.
- There are command line ways to run it with Gradle, but honestly I just click Run.

## Screenshots
(I’ll add screenshots here once I run the app and capture them from the emulator.)
